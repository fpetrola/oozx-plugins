/**
 * How one emulator draws its picture.
 * <p>
 * Built by walking the knobs the screen offers rather than listing them here, so an effect added
 * to the engine appears in this window without anybody editing it. That is the whole point of
 * the settings describing themselves: a window written as a hand-made mirror of the list goes
 * out of step with it on the third change and nobody notices which side is wrong.
 * <p>
 * Changes land on the emulator as they are made — this is the window someone watches the picture
 * through while they turn things, so it would be no use if it needed closing first. They belong
 * to that emulator alone; the button at the bottom is how they become what new ones open with.
 */
/**
 * Everything the screen can be told, as a panel: the looks to start from, the knobs, and the two
 * buttons about what a new screen opens with. In a window of its own while a game is played, and
 * in the Video tab of the settings, which is the same question asked from somewhere else.
