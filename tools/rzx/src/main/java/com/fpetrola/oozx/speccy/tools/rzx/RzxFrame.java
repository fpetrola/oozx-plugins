/**
 * Drives a recording: what is in the file, how far along it is, and play, pause and take over.
 * <p>
 * The picture is not here. A recording brings its own machine, and that machine goes into an
 * ordinary emulator window like any other, which is what makes {@link RzxSession#release() taking
 * over} mean something: stop the recording at an interesting moment and the same machine carries
 * on reading the keyboard, with the game exactly where the recording left it. This window is the
 * controls and the contents, the way the cassette browser is for a tape.
 * <p>
 * The machine runs on this window's thread either way, because while a recording plays it is the
 * recording that drives the processor, not the machine's clock. After taking over, the same
 * thread runs the ordinary loop instead.
 * <p>
 * How fast it plays comes from the machine's own speed setting, so the emulator window's speed
 * control works on a replay as it does on anything else.
