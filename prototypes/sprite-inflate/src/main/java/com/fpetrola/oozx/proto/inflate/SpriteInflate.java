/**
 * A sprite, given a body: xBRZ for the outline, a distance field for the bulge, a mesh out the
 * other end.
 * <p>
 * The pipeline is five steps and each one exists for a reason worth stating:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>xBRZ 4x.</b> What reads as jagged once a sprite is standing up in 3D is its outline,
 *       and this is the thing that fixes outlines without inventing colours.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coverage, not a mask.</b> xBRZ leaves blended pixels along every edge, and that blend
 *       IS the sub-pixel information the 4x bought. Thresholding it back to hard pixels throws
 *       that away and leaves stair-steps four times smaller, which is not the same as smooth.
 *       So the alpha is kept as fractional coverage and the outline is taken at coverage 0.5.</li>
 *   <li><b>A distance field</b> inside that outline, exact (Felzenszwalb's transform), telling
 *       every point how far it is from the edge.</li>
 *   <li><b>Local thickness</b> - the radius of the largest inscribed disc that covers a point,
 *       which is what tells a two-pixel leg it is a two-pixel leg and not part of the torso.</li>
 *   <li><b>The bulge</b>, which is where the profiles below differ, mirrored: the same amount
 *       forwards as backwards, so a section across a limb is a whole ellipse. The two halves meet
 *       at the outline, where the depth is zero, so the solid closes without a wall around the
 *       rim - and the figure is symmetric, which is what it should be if it is to be turned all
 *       the way round rather than looked at from the front.</li>
 * </ol>
