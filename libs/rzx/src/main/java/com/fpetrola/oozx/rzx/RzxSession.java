 * A machine set up to replay a recording: its ports read from the recording rather than from the
 * hardware, and it starts from the state the recording was made at.
 * <p>
 * The ports are replaced by overriding the binding of {@link IO}, which is why the machine itself
 * needs no say in it. The recording carries the machine's state at the moment recording began, as
 * a snapshot the parser hands over already expanded, so it is written out and loaded the same way
 * any snapshot is.
 * <p>
 * The replacement is a switch rather than a substitution: {@link #release()} puts the real ports
 * back, and from then on the machine is an ordinary one that reads its keyboard, carrying whatever
 * state the recording left it in. That is the point of playing a recording in a window like any
 * other emulator's - stop watching at an interesting moment and take over.
