/**
 * Types LOAD "" on the emulated keyboard and starts the tape.
 * <p>
 * This is a state machine stepped from the emulation loop rather than a thread that sleeps
 * alongside it: the emulator runs at {@code emulationSpeed} (200x real time by default), so
 * wall-clock delays translate into wildly different amounts of emulated time from one run to
 * the next, and the keystrokes race the loop that is supposed to read them.
 * <p>
 * Keys go through {@link com.fpetrola.oozx.speccy.modules.keyboard.KeyMatrix}. Writing the key code into
 * LAST_K and raising bit 5 of FLAGS does not register as a keypress here, so a LOAD typed that
 * way never reaches the interpreter and the machine stays in the editor.
 * <p>
 * The tape runs at {@code loadingSpeed} so a multi-minute load takes seconds, and the emulator
 * drops to {@code speedAfterLoading} once the deck stops, so the game itself plays at its real
 * pace. Both switches happen with the tape idle: raising the speed before it starts and lowering
 * it after it has stopped, never mid-block, since changing speed resets the clock the tape times
 * its pulses against.
