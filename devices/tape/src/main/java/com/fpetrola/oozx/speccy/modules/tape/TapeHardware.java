/**
 * Which machine a tape says it was made for, asked of the tape.
 * <p>
 * A TZX carries the answer in its hardware type block: a list of machines, and for each one
 * whether the tape runs on it and whether it uses what that machine has that others do not. That
 * last part is the whole point here - a game marked as using the 128K's features has music on a
 * 128K and silence on a 48K, and loading it into the smaller machine is how somebody ends up
 * never hearing it.
 * <p>
 * A TAP carries nothing at all: it is blocks and no statement about anything, which is why the
 * caller still has a fallback for those.
