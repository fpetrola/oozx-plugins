 * A gamepad driving the joystick of the machine its window is clipped to, the way the keyboard
 * follows the machine in front. Read through Jamepad, which brings SDL along for every desktop, so
 * nothing here knows which one it is running on. The d-pad or the left stick steer and any face
 * button fires; plugged in, it is the Kempston interface of the machine it drives.
 * <p>
 * The interface is fitted whether or not a pad is found, because with none the keys stand in for
 * one, and something has to be there for them to hold.
