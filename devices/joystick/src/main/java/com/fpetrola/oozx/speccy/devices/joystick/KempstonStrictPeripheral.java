 * The Kempston as most things decode it: bit 5 low.

 * is there is theirs to say. It is handed the question rather than the settings - the answer has
 * to be read when a machine is selected and not frozen when this is built, because somebody can
 * turn it on while the emulator runs, but that needs a question and not everything the emulator
 * has ever been configured with.
